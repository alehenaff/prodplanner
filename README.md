Django DRF project to calculate dates for reccuring actions

Based on dateutil ; it is possible to define rrules and dates and create rrulesets including or excluding rrulesets, rrules or datetimes.

The first goal is to get a list of dates, not datetimes.

To perform it :

* rrules are defined at '/planner/simplerules/',
* dates at '/planner/daterules/'
* rrulesets at '/planner/rulesets/'
* including or excluding elements from a rruleset at '/planner/rulesetelements/'

it is then possible to query a rruleset to get occurences on a time interval :

http://localhost:8000/planner/rulesets/a66d4242-8e2e-43bd-ba49-3970dc51ca28/between/?start=2017-01-01T00:00:00&end=2018-01-01T00:00:00

```

    "2017-01-01",
    "2017-04-17",
    "2017-05-01",
    "2017-05-08",
    "2017-05-26",
    "2017-06-05",
    "2017-07-14",
    "2017-08-15",
    "2017-11-01",
    "2017-11-11",
    "2017-12-25",
    "2018-01-01"
]
```
It is also possible to get next 10 occurences for a ruleset :

http://localhost:8000/planner/rulesets/a66d4242-8e2e-43bd-ba49-3970dc51ca28/next10/
```

    "2017-05-26",
    "2017-06-05",
    "2017-07-14",
    "2017-08-15",
    "2017-11-01",
    "2017-11-11",
    "2017-12-25",
    "2018-01-01"
]
```

python manage.py makemigrations

python manage.py migrate

Load fixtures : python manage.py loaddata fixtures/planner.json

The second goal is to schedule tasks
To create a schedule you must select a ruleset and a delta which is based
on dateutil.relativedelta and then choose the daytime (hour, minute, second)
delta configuration is accessible at http://localhost:8000/planner/deltas/

A task will be generated for each occurence in the ruleset.
The task will have the start datetime set to the date of the ruleset occurence
with the time of the day chosen in the schedule.
The end of the task will be calculated from the start plus the
dateutil.relativedelta calculated from the delta object associated in the schedule.


Via django shell it is possible to generate tasks with :
```
import datetime
start = datetime.datetime(2017,4,25)
end = datetime.datetime(2018,4,25)
s = Schedule.objects.get(id='uuid-xxx-xxx-xxx')
from planner.models import schedule_models
schedule_models.task_generate(s, start, end)
```



# version
Alpha developpement

# tested with

* Python 3.5.3
* Django 1.10.6

# todo
* make it as a library or django-app
* be able to change date of a task (without be regenerated by task_generate)
* manage timezones
* ... suggestions welcomed
